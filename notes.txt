OBESERVATIONS

LIMIT OPPONENTS PLAY: 
	- lost queen early because it kept trying to check and attack the king with no support

	- stalemate and checkmate are equally successful, bc they limit opp's moves

	-- want to prioritize checkmating the opponent
		if there is a move that checks, prioritize it



LIMIT OPPONENT'S PLAY WITH MINIMAX: 
	- consistently goes for the four move checkmate
	- but it seems to keep playing moves that draw for some reason 
	- still hangs some free pieces 

	--- going to bring back the material evaluation, so that it doesn't drop pieces



LIMIT_OPP X MATERIAL X MINIMAX @ depth 3: 
	- plays much better now, doesn't unnecessarily sacrifice pieces

	- for some reason, even when it has a clear checkmate, it evaluates another move as better. I think one reason for this might be that it sees two paths: 
		one path leads to checkmate after some redundant moves
		another path is immediate checkmate

		but since the second path has nothing to offer in terms of my current position evaluation, fatbot sticks with its original path and plays that move

		--- which means that I have to also give worth to a smaller path. In other words, if I get a previously-reached score by going less deep into the tree, choose that move.




LIMIT_OPP X MATERIAL X MINIMAX x ALPHABETA @ depth 4: 
	- fatbot takes a lottt more time to play moves
		--- hopefully I can speed this up by evaluating better moves first 

	- I still run into the same issue here. It had a clear checkmate, yet chose a different path. 
		-- next steps: 
			evaluate better moves first
			opt for smaller depth (although this might just be solved by 	previous)
